# LCDM (Life Choice Decision Maker)

</hr>

For when you just can't decide...
Have a rough decision to make? Can't make up your mind? Use the LCDM to randomly select between two choices, whether it be what food you want to eat to which college you want to attend. Let the LCDM take care of it for you.

There's no harm in letting a computer program run your life, probably.

**LCDM Repo**

This is a very simple repo!

index.html - this is the homepage and embeds ALL JS scripts inside of it

We can separate the scripts if we want to for easier editing.

Other than that, just images and google tags.
