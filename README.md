# LCDM (Life Choice Decision Maker)

<hr/>

For when you just can't decide...
Have a rough decision to make? Can't make up your mind? Use the LCDM to randomly select between two choices, whether it be what food you want to eat to which college you want to attend. Let the LCDM take care of it for you.

There's no harm in letting a computer program run your life, probably.

**LCDM Repo**

_This is a very simple repo!_

index.html - this is the homepage and embeds ALL JS scripts inside of it<br/>
mainCss.css - this is the style sheet for the homepage<br/>
footerLinks.js - these are the simple scripts for the footer popups<br/>
submit.js - this is the script for the random number generator and is called upon when "discovering your doom" <br/>

Other than that, just images and google tags.

TODO:<br/>
Make mobile friendly<br/>
Add sounds<br/>
Add skins <br/>
